# hx711-pico

C++ driver for the [hx711 24-bit ADC](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/813/hx711_english-1022875.pdf) using the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2350) and the Pico SDK.  
The hx711 is commonly used with load cells to build digital scales.  
This repository provides a modern C++ class for the Pico, plus calibration examples.

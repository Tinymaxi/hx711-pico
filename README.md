# hx711-pico

C++ driver for the [hx711 24-bit ADC](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/813/hx711_english-1022875.pdf) using the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2350) and the Pico SDK.  
The hx711 is commonly used with load cells to build digital scales.  
This repository provides a modern C++ class for the Pico, plus calibration examples.

## âœ¨ Features
- Supports the HX711 24-bit ADC for load cells
- Fixed configuration: Gain = 128, Output Rate = 10 samples per second (SPS)
- Simple calibration routine with tare and scale factor
- Example applications included:
  - Calibration
  - Raw sensor value reading
  - Saving the calibration to flash memory
    enablig weighin without new calibratin after powering back on.
- Compatible with Raspberry Pi RP2350 and Pico SDK (CMake build system)
- Uses RP2350â€™s Programmable I/O (PIO) for efficient sampling
- **Parallel reads:** Each RP2350 PIO block can run four state machines, 
  allowing up to four HX711 load cells to be read in parallel
